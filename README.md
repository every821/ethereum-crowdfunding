#Cloud funding Blockchain application using brownie framework

This decentralized application can store ethereum. Only the owner can make withdrawals, but anyone could donate any amount of more than 4$. 
The Smart contract is been written using Solidity. using chainlink, It can check the current price of Ethereum. It's important because we said earlier users can donate more than 4$ valued ethereum. so we take the current price from chainlink and after the comparison, the transaction could be made.


##The technology we have used:
> 1. Python
> 2. Solidity
> 3. Web3
> 4. Brownie framework
> 5. infura ( I upload this on live test network)
